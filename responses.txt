SPEECH RECORD 1 - Group A
 - What the f***?
 - Ohai, rock (surprised by boulder)
 - Loving the fat wizard
 - You can't destroy the rock!
 - What is the dash button?
 - I didn't know there were enemies
 - 7 money is bad
 - I'm gonna go exploring
 - Cody's getting gangb**ged over there
 - 57! I feel like that's pretty good; what are you guys at? I'm gonna screenpeak like a son of a b***h.
 - Can we fight in this thing (shop)?
 - F***ing chicken, why does this beat the laser?
 - Why do I keep ending up here (on death)?
 - We've gotta buy stuff (during final fight)
 - The cooldown is broken (laser).
 - I didn't get any money until the end.

SPEECH RECORD 2 - Group A
 - Why do you kill people? There's no money.
 - <General dash confusion>
 - Ok, so purple's poison
 - Ok, I found a knight
 - I'm stuck between a skeleton and the wall.
 - Hmm. (Confused at having one-shot 3 successive skeletons)
 - What's this red thing on the floor (button)?
    - Maybe that activates the traps.
 - I can't turn around right (backing up into another player, unable to attack)
 - That dash. Nice dash man!
 - This sword is kinda legit.
 - What the f*** is happening (during final battle)?


(Answers in order)
CODY EDE - CME527
Yes, though he didn't know what the weapons were except by trial and error
 - No (laser)
 - No

Sword was worth it, but couldn't find shotgun
 - Made purchases very late in the game

More map knowledge would be nice
 - Screen is a little small (1080p)

Negative reaction to stumbling upon already looted chest areas

Really enjoyed the organic battles

Players were a huge part
 - 50/50 around a lot / on his own

Yeah, really liked 2-knight pincer room (barely survived with 4 health). Aliens are squishy, knights are tanky

Didn't utilize traps against players

Turrets were pretty trivial.
 - Liked "outside the box" poison dashing puzzles

Yeah, but didn't feel threatened if he had higher HP than opponent
 - Controls are a little clunky

Final comments: Could use more time to learn controls. The rounds themselves could be shorter, though he wanted to avoid sacrificing time to explore


CHRIS SIM - CJS517
Had fun, would play again (more fun than expected)

Not really able to purchase anything; died a lot at the start and chests were gone

Starting with a weapon > starting with a chicken

Upgrades were worth it
 - Missiles were hard to use

Start for controls helped
 - Forgot dash

Hiding gold -> extra button press, but understands why it's currently this way

Didn't drag on
 - Right length, it prompts him to want to play more

Had time to explore
 - First rooms got memorized

Players had a huge impact
 - First battle
 - Filed out first exit
 - Bit of a break to explore
 - Brought back to origin => made huge difference to PvP

Non-Player Enemies
 - "It really didn't"
 - easy to avoid

Traps didn't effect PvP
 - Some deterrents
 - Rock fell on my head
 - No difference out of combat
   - Treasure very worth it

Sources of damage worth avoiding
 - Take quite a few hits in battle
 - gold is worth it

DYLAN FLOWERS - DBF258
Yes, once he knew where they were.

Yes

Was able to get quickly what they wanted

Upgrades were good
 - Got Weapon levels and jump

Well balanced
 - A good strategy was the buy early and fight later

Not really (can't see people's golds after all)

Didn't know they could break through rock

No

Yes

Felt after a while of looting, swapped to PK even though there were 1 or 2 chests left

Ya

Where the fun was

Comments: Weapons fights can be a bit repetetive / Likes the base concept of the game (Explore, then fight!)

ARLEN MUC - AJM589
Beginning was hard, not enough time
 - Once you got going, you got to figure it out

Weapons totally worth it - more damage
 - Didn't get to try other upgrades

Odd to see money with button, rather than always
 - Spawn camping during the end is very powerful

No drag

Yes, but it doesn't feel neccessary

I enjoyed it, first game I had no idea what even, so I jumped on their head to screw with them

Not much of an obstacle, annoying when it trapped me in a door
 - Nic obstacle, not too distracting

Got hit by a few, didn't really find out what did what right away (not intuitive)

annoying not knowing why they were going off, button discovery was too late in the game

For the most part, yes. Didn't feel like a huge letdown when you took damage, but I definitely felt I should avoid it

Early game rent is too fast and it's hard to get to know what's up.

ROWAN YATES - RKY127 (Observed 4 other people playing the game)
Gold flow seems fine
 - Should communicate upgrades better

State of game clear

Players are a mjaor impact 
 - Couldn't ignore eachother
 - Other options open

Traps minimal without players
 - Hard to initially learn proper use

NPCs a threat if not avoided

Player fighting definitely significant
