SPEECH RECORD 1 - Group A
 - What the f***?
 - Ohai, rock (surprised by boulder)
 - Loving the fat wizard
 - You can't destroy the rock!
 - What is the dash button?
 - I didn't know there were enemies
 - 7 money is bad
 - I'm gonna go exploring
 - Cody's getting gangb**ged over there
 - 57! I feel like that's pretty good; what are you guys at? I'm gonna screenpeak like a son of a b***h.
 - Can we fight in this thing (shop)?
 - F***ing chicken, why does this beat the laser?
 - Why do I keep ending up here (on death)?
 - We've gotta buy stuff (during final fight)
 - The cooldown is broken (laser).
 - I didn't get any money until the end.

SPEECH RECORD 2 - Group A
 - Why do you kill people? There's no money.
 - <General dash confusion>
 - Ok, so purple's poison
 - Ok, I found a knight
 - I'm stuck between a skeleton and the wall.
 - Hmm. (Confused at having one-shot 3 successive skeletons)
 - What's this red thing on the floor (button)?
    - Maybe that activates the traps.
 - I can't turn around right (backing up into another player, unable to attack)
 - That dash. Nice dash man!
 - This sword is kinda legit.
 - What the f*** is happening (during final battle)?


SPEECH RECORD 3 - GROUP B
 - Which one am I?
 - Where do we go?
 - How do I get money? (start area)
 - <generally stuck behind a fallen rock, unaware it can be damaged>
 - <door confusion>
 - How to get out of the shop?
 - Is this the only level, or what? (Origin area)
 - Run away! Ah!
 - Does this door not work?
 - Does the chicken do damage?
 - How do I get back to the shop?
 - What is that thing (boulder)? Do I beat it?
 - Oh, it's a turret.
 - I now have a gun.

   - (After explanation) Oh, so that's how it works

 - How do you get to the shop?
 - Come here, so I can nunchuk you! <laughter>
 - <Trying doors> Is that... No... Is that...? No... Is that... No...
 - Where is everybody?
 - Oh, I won!

SPEECH RECOD 4 - GROUP B
 - I want your money
 - You bugger, you stole my chest!
 - Get off my head!
 - Oh! Double Kill!
 - I'm just gonna say, I have no money.
 - How much do you have?
   - 259.
   - Just sayin', we should team up against him.
 - Is this called spawn camping?
 - I prematurely fired.
 - Is this one of those chests?
 - Aliens! Oh, he's pushing me!
 - Stop going off the edge!
 - Where is Santa Claus?
 - Why won't it let me jump? (Stuck on turret collision box)
 - Stop it santa!
 - I like how it teleports you back to where you teleported in.
 - I was trying to teleport to the shop when we got moved there, and I teleported out before I could upgrade my weapons.
 - <Tracking issues on missiles>
 - Look at that cash!
 - I've got 3 (gold), but I've got a weapon
 - Comon, open door!

(Answers in order)
CODY EDE - CME527
Yes, though he didn't know what the weapons were except by trial and error
 - No (laser)
 - No

Sword was worth it, but couldn't find shotgun
 - Made purchases very late in the game

More map knowledge would be nice
 - Screen is a little small (1080p)

Negative reaction to stumbling upon already looted chest areas

Really enjoyed the organic battles

Players were a huge part
 - 50/50 around a lot / on his own

Yeah, really liked 2-knight pincer room (barely survived with 4 health). Aliens are squishy, knights are tanky

Didn't utilize traps against players

Turrets were pretty trivial.
 - Liked "outside the box" poison dashing puzzles

Yeah, but didn't feel threatened if he had higher HP than opponent
 - Controls are a little clunky

Final comments: Could use more time to learn controls. The rounds themselves could be shorter, though he wanted to avoid sacrificing time to explore


CHRIS SIM - CJS517
Had fun, would play again (more fun than expected)

Not really able to purchase anything; died a lot at the start and chests were gone

Starting with a weapon > starting with a chicken

Upgrades were worth it
 - Missiles were hard to use

Start for controls helped
 - Forgot dash

Hiding gold -> extra button press, but understands why it's currently this way

Didn't drag on
 - Right length, it prompts him to want to play more

Had time to explore
 - First rooms got memorized

Players had a huge impact
 - First battle
 - Filed out first exit
 - Bit of a break to explore
 - Brought back to origin => made huge difference to PvP

Non-Player Enemies
 - "It really didn't"
 - easy to avoid

Traps didn't effect PvP
 - Some deterrents
 - Rock fell on my head
 - No difference out of combat
   - Treasure very worth it

Sources of damage worth avoiding
 - Take quite a few hits in battle
 - gold is worth it

DYLAN FLOWERS - DBF258
Yes, once he knew where they were.

Yes

Was able to get quickly what they wanted

Upgrades were good
 - Got Weapon levels and jump

Well balanced
 - A good strategy was the buy early and fight later

Not really (can't see people's golds after all)

Didn't know they could break through rock

No

Yes

Felt after a while of looting, swapped to PK even though there were 1 or 2 chests left

Ya

Where the fun was

Comments: Weapons fights can be a bit repetetive / Likes the base concept of the game (Explore, then fight!)

ARLEN MUC - AJM589
Beginning was hard, not enough time
 - Once you got going, you got to figure it out

Weapons totally worth it - more damage
 - Didn't get to try other upgrades

Odd to see money with button, rather than always
 - Spawn camping during the end is very powerful

No drag

Yes, but it doesn't feel neccessary

I enjoyed it, first game I had no idea what even, so I jumped on their head to screw with them

Not much of an obstacle, annoying when it trapped me in a door
 - Nic obstacle, not too distracting

Got hit by a few, didn't really find out what did what right away (not intuitive)

annoying not knowing why they were going off, button discovery was too late in the game

For the most part, yes. Didn't feel like a huge letdown when you took damage, but I definitely felt I should avoid it

Early game rent is too fast and it's hard to get to know what's up.

ROWAN YATES - RKY127 (Observed 4 other people playing the game)
Gold flow seems fine
 - Should communicate upgrades better

State of game clear

Players are a mjaor impact 
 - Couldn't ignore eachother
 - Other options open

Traps minimal without players
 - Hard to initially learn proper use

NPCs a threat if not avoided

Player fighting definitely significant

CONNOR NETTLETON-GOODING - CWN973
 - Not, had teleporting issues
   - Upgrades were decent for weapons, didn't bother with dash, jump, et al.
     - Laser/Gun primary weapons used

 - More damage; range worthless due to lack of flat areas.
   - Guns < knives
   - Couldn't turn around to shoot when being pushed

 - Other player's positions would have been good
   - Suggests indicators above doors

 - Not really.
   - Could use a warning before finale
   - Issues with looting, ended up on emptied branches and got screwed
   - Payout of chests not obvious

 - Yes

 - Not much; didn't show up until the finales, except Shane "would drop from the sky and kill me".

 - Not really; did minimal damage
   - Spent time stuck on skeleton, turret

 - Committed suicide on spikes to prevent Shane from getting his gold

 - Moderately annoying; got stuck a lot on spikes and the turret

 - Players, yes, traps and NPCs not so much because they did negligible damage.

Comments: Spawn camping sucked / Damage screwed momentum / Got stuck on stationary turrets / Immediately left shop too many times by accident

LEEJAY SCHMIDT - LJS302
 - 1st time yes, didn't completely understand how to get money.

 - Rocket was awesome

 - KNowing beforehand what thing will look like before you start would be good

 - No, confusing at times, a map would be very helpful

 - For the most part yes, definitely once you know the game more (early play it's short)

 - When I was getting shot at, a big one.

 - Never found many (found 1 turret)

 - No difference noticed

 - Not at all (likely not exploring)

 - Yes, jst because of fear of damage

 - Chest opening mechanic should be laid out

SHANE WILLIAMSON (He's in CMPT 306)
 - Able to upgrades

 - Definitely; upgrades are a HUGE improvement
   - Like the fact that currency is hidden
   - HUD not intrusive

 - Not dragged on while "in the mix"

 - Fun to explore
   - Fun to nab chests/obstacles

 - Other players significant/positive impact
   - land in same room/enjoyable

 - Aliens could lock you in one direction

 - Not good, but wants to use them against players
   - Awesome idea

 - Traps weren't huge outside combat
   - Was a factor

 - Sources of damage worth avoidance?
   - YES
   - Definitely "chunk" you
   - Depending on health, maybe not much worry

 - Standing on head tough to move

MARINA SCHMIDT - MTS299
 - No, no clue
   - Upgrades confusing; how to buy?
     - Outside of shop clear

 - No idea

 - Shop unclear; didn't understand how to dash

 - Losing, game felt like it dragged

 - A lot
   - Once I fell behind, couldn't fight
     - couldn't get away to do anything else

 - NPCs didn't effect me at all
   - Target practice; kind of fun
     - Kill something at least, simple

 - Traps didn't affect PvP
   - Other players completely avoided pre-emptively

 - Traps easy to avoid in non-PvP

 - Stationary traps worth avoiding
   - NPCs not

 - Teleports kinda confusing
   - Being ported to shop without money on death felt pointless.
